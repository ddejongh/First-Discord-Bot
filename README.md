# First-Discord-Bot
Randy is the name that was randomly generated by a name generator when starting this project. Therefore, this bot's formal name is Randy. For other purposes, this is my first Discord bot. 

The purposes of this project (tentative) are to: 
- Learn JS
- Learn Web Development practices and principles
- Practice using Git 
- Explore Software Engineering 

Notes: 
- Token and prefix are contained in config.json
