# Sense-Bot
Sense is my first Discord bot. General commands and more coming soon.
Hopefully nobody looks at the number of commits, pretty sure they are all "Update README.md"

To-Do:
- ~~Add `play` command~~
- ~~Restructure command handler~~
- Clean up code 
- Re-add `play` command
- Add `stop`
- Add `weather`

Before use:
- `npm install discord.js ffmpeg fluent-ffmpeg @discordjs/opus ytdl-core --save`

The purposes of this project (tentative) are to: 
- Learn JS
- Learn Web Development practices and principles
- Practice using Git 
- Explore Software Engineering 

Notes: 
- Token and prefix are contained in config.json
- Requires: ytdl-core discord.js ffmpeg
